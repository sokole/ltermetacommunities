	Abstract = {Demographic data will play a central role in testing current theories in plant ecology and forecasting the effects of global change. However, long term data on vital rates are very limited, especially for species in herbaceous plant communities. Here we present a data set that has great potential to increase our understanding of plant demographic processes. Every year from 1932 to 1972, researchers in Hays, Kansas (USA), mapped all individual plants in a series of 1{\^a}m2 quadrats in a mixed grass prairie. The rare combination of temporal extent and fine spatial resolution makes it possible to follow individual herbaceous plants (or genets) through time and to answer questions such as: How does individual survival and recruitment vary with precipitation and temperature? How are these relationships modified by interactions with neighboring conspecifics and heterospecifics? The data set includes the digitized maps in Arc Export format, a tabular, nonspatial version of the entire data set, descriptive information about each quadrat including its sampling schedule, a species list containing information on plant functional types, and monthly climate data.},

@article{delMoral2005,
	Abstract = {The nitrogen-fixing legume Lupinus lepidus is the most abundant herb on new volcanic surfaces at Mount St. Helen. We compared vegetation structure in 30 Lupinus colonies in three age classes (old, mature, or young based on known years of their establishment) to adjacent sites that were sparsely populated by Lupinus. Our goals were to determine if the age of colonies affected either species composition or vegetation structure and if colonies altered vegetation structure of a site. Species richness increased with site age and colonies had significantly greater richness. Mature colonies had lower cover and frequency of other species, while old colonies had significantly higher cover of other species, particularly mosses. Frequencies in colonies were higher than in adjacent sites. Diversity measures were highest in old colonies and least in mature ones. ANOVA showed that density effects of Lupinus were stronger than age effects on richness, cover, frequency, dominance, and diversity. The floristic similarity between colonies and adjacent sites declined with colony age, and sites without Lupinus became heterogeneous with age. Detrended correspondence analysis demonstrated floristic change as colonies aged and that the differences between colonies and sparse sites increased with age. Regressions of Lupinus frequency with measures of structure showed weak second order relationships that suggested that low densities of Lupinus inhibited other species, while higher densities promoted abundance and diversity. Together these results suggest that Lupinus is a key element that alters floristic successional trajectories and accelerates succession. However, its effects are complicated by the wide ranges of Lupinus density, the sequence of invasion, and by herbivores.},

	abstract = {This data package was produced by researchers working on the Shortgrass Steppe Long Term Ecological Research (SGS-LTER) Project, administered at Colorado State University. Long-term datasets and background information (proposals, reports, photographs, etc.) on the SGS-LTER project are contained in a comprehensive project collection within the Digital Collections of Colorado (http://digitool.library.colostate.edu/R/?func=collections\&amp;collection\_id=3429). The data table and associated metadata document, which is generated in Ecological Metadata Language, may be available through other repositories serving the ecological research community and represent components of the larger SGS-LTER project collection. When the CPER was established in 1939, researchers constructed a .5-1 ha grazing exclosure in each of the pastures. These areas have remained protected from grazing for the past 70 years. The remaining areas have been grazed for the past 20+ years. This collection of pastures and exclosures provided an extraordinary opportunity to reinitiate grazing and protection, and evaluate the balance between degradation and aggradation. We proposed to rearrange fences and expose areas to grazing that have been protected for 50 years, and protect areas from grazing that had been grazed for 50 years. The combinations of grazing conditions were: 1. Long-term protection 2. Long-term grazing (moderate) 3. 50 years of protection followed by grazing 4. 50 years of grazing followed by protection Net primary production, nitrogen dynamics, cattle utilization, and community dynamics of vegetation were measured.

	abstract = {I established 92 permanent plots on Mount St. Helens starting in 1980 in order to document vegetation recovery from volcanic disturbances. I report data in 1743 records (plot × year), containing 85 species. These represent most common species found in non-forested habitats on Mount St. Helens. Richness, percent cover, diversity (H′ and evenness), and species frequency of a plot are reported. Plots were sampled using 24 quadrats placed in the same location in each sample year by the same observer. Habitats sampled included those experiencing primary succession, secondary succession, and recovery from disturbance. These data have been used to test hypotheses concerning succession trajectories and patterns of species assembly. They also may be used to test models of succession, determine succession rates by several methods, and explore assembly processes and rules. Four files provide the data: (1) the matrix of species in each plot in each year; (2) the matrix of structural measures (e.g., richness) in each plot in each year; (3) taxonomic and life-history characteristics of species in the data set; and (4) geographic and landscape factors for each plot. The data are described in a metadata file, which includes numerous time-series images. The complete data sets corresponding to abstracts published in the Data Papers section of the journal are published electronically in Ecological Archives at 〈http://esapubs.org/archive〉.
